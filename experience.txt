This class will be my first major exposure to software exploitation. This now seems slightly odd to me. As I have begun to dig into the material, it appears I have been software exploitation-adjacent for quite some time. In one case, I helped build a software security management program using software composition analysis and static application security testing tools to ensure my company's code was not introducing unnecessary vulnerabilities. I have also taken courses/trainings in intrusion detection and malware analysis, where the focus was on observing malware behaviors for IoCs and analyzing malicious documents for "dropper" PE files. I'm looking forward to being able to better audit the security of my company's software and also being able to understand better craft detection signatures based on my knowledge of how software exploitation can occur.
